This retrospective cohort study -- a type of observational study where the researchers look back in time -- was just published in [**Public Health**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350622003328)  
in collaboration with [**Covid Long-Haulers Support Group Canada**.](http://www.covidlonghaulcanada.com/) 

In this study, researchers at emergency departments across the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network compared 
long-term physical and mental health outcomes of people with or without COVID-19. 

Patients were tested for COVID-19 during their visit to the emergency department, and then given questionnaires around 6 months later, and then again around 1.5 months later after that. 
Participants were matched on baseline characteristics to control for individual variability and seasonal effects.

Patients who had COVID-19 and went to the emergency department for treatment reported having a lower mental health status during the follow-up period. 
Physical health scores for patients with and without a history of COVID-19 were similar in follow up, suggesting that the pandemic was detrimental to 
both groups, whether or not they actually had COVID-19!
